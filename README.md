# Frontend Mentor - Pod request access landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Pod request access landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pod-request-access-landing-page-eyTmdkLSG)

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
- The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
- The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.
